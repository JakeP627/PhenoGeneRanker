GenerateWalkMatrix.R: Generates Complete Multiplex Heterogeneous Network (Walk Matrix - WM) using multiple gene/protein layers and phenotype layers.
RunRWR.R: Takes gene and phenotype seed file as input, and runs the RWR on Complete Multiplex Heterogenous WM and generates ranking results.
PhenoGeneRankerFunctions.R: Functions are used by GenerateWalkMatrix.R and RunRWR.R
Utils.R: Some utility functions.
